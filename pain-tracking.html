						<p class="lead">The problem</p>
						<p>Millions of people suffer from physical pain that handicaps their personal and professional life, causing a great deal of <b>mental suffering</b> as well <b>dissociation</b> of the person from their body.</p>
						<p>The companion was designed to allow individuals suffering from chronic pain to <b>track their pain’s evolution everyday</b> in a way that empowers them to become experts of their bodies and their pain.</p>
						<p>This was a particularly relevant project because previous interviews with chronic pain afflicted people showed me that when one gained a sense of <b>ownership</b> over their pain, it made it way more tolerable mentally and gave the individual a stronger sense of <b>agency</b>.</p>

						<li>Make the users feel heard and understood: they are the experts of their own pain</li>
						<li>Incorporate several pain-scaling questionnaires into an app</li>
						<li>Allow the users to get feedback in a Quantified Self Approach</li>
						<li>Make the terms and conditions as transparent and GDPR friendly as possible</li>

						<h3>1. Product definition with card-sorting exercise and userflows</h3>
						<p>The research team and the product owner gave me a list of functionalities and user stories that they deduced from interviews with people that have chronic pain.</p>
						<p>From there, I created an app architecture that I deduced from card-sorting exercises I carried out with several users where each card was a functionality.</p>
						<p>That way, the architecture that I defined was <b>consistent with the user's mental models</b>. I concretized this step with userflows that made this architecture easy to understand for all stakeholders of the project.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col col-lg-6">
					<div class="skill">
						<h3>2. Gamification design</h3>
						<p>The app was gamified in order to make it more pleasant and encourage the user to use it daily for more accurate tracking.</p>
						<p>I created a multi-level gamification system that <b>rewarded the user for performing crucial actions</b> such as tracking their pain or filling out their medical profile for a more accurate analysis.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

			<div class="row text-center">
				<div class="col-6 offset-3">
					<div class="skill">
						<h3>3. Lo / hi-res prototyping and user testing</h3>
						<p>First, I created <b>paper prototypes</b> that I tested with internal staff which revealed me some usability in the interface, and GDPR comprehension issues in the wording that led me to create an A and B versions of the consenting process. This process was paper prototyped and tested again, which saved a lot of resources that we would have used if we had realised these issues later.</p>
						<p>I then created hi-fidelity <b>dynamic prototypes</b> with Axure (after one more round of testing and redesigning) that allowed to concretize the app definition to deliver to the stakeholders and developers.</p>
						<p>Particular attention was put on the user's <b>consent</b> by being transparent on which data we collected and why by using exact understandable wording.</p>
