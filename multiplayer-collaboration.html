                <h2 class="heading-5"><strong>Situation</strong></h2>
                <div class="w-richtext">
                  <p>Our product couldn't expand across schools because it lacked the foundations for multi-educator collaboration on student instruction. Teachers were patching together their own systems for lesson planning, student tracking, and collaboration outside the product — treating it as a content library rather than a facilitator of the jobs they needed to get done.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Three core problems were blocking growth:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Feature gaps</strong>: Educators had no way to document student progress, share notes, or coordinate within the platform, so they relied on external tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>No proof of ROI</strong>: Without robust student profiles and progress data, we couldn't convince our buyers — school administrators — to purchase or renew subscriptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>No collaboration</strong>: Supporting students with complex needs requires multiple educators working together, but the product made data sharing nearly impossible.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="w-richtext">
                  <p>Before we could build anything, we needed to understand why educators weren't engaging with existing student features. We ran discovery interviews with educators using the platform, focusing on their collaboration habits and the barriers to adoption.</p>

                  <p>Sarah, a Speech Therapist supporting over 60 students with autism, captured what we heard repeatedly:</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <em>"I would never go in there [the students and groups page]. I have to get on my computer. I have to log in... If the free trial ends then that's all gonna be lost. If I buy a subscription and don't renew it in time, it's all gonna be lost. I don't want to spend the time, honestly, setting it up and then going through it. Like I have my way of doing things that's quick."</em>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Key blockers we identified:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li>Fear of losing data if a subscription lapsed</li>
                    <li>No understanding of the value of student profiles</li>
                    <li>Reluctance to add another tool to an already complex workflow</li>
                    <li>License limitations restricting collaboration across a team</li>
                    <li>No perceived need to assign homework digitally</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>At the same time, we observed strong collaboration habits happening <em>outside</em> the product:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li>Taking shared notes about students and groups</li>
                    <li>Exchanging materials and content recommendations</li>
                    <li>Updating each other on content used to avoid overlaps</li>
                    <li>Making joint decisions on student support levels</li>
                  </ul>

                <h3 class="heading-style-h5">Step 2: Ideation workshops — prioritising high-value "quick wins"</h3>
                <div class="w-richtext">
                  <p>We ran ideation workshops to generate and score potential features using an <strong>Impact × Confidence × Ease</strong> framework. This helped us cut through opinion and focus on the opportunities most likely to move the needle quickly.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>Top-ranked features:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li><strong>Document storage within student profiles</strong> — Score: 144</li>
                    <li><strong>Social skills report based on content watched</strong> — Score: 140</li>
                    <li><strong>Written notes about a student or group</strong> — Score: 108</li>
                    <li><strong>Share Playlists with colleagues</strong> — Score: 84</li>
                    <li><strong>Assigning content to be watched for a specific lesson</strong> — Score: 72</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>We also explored a simpler entry point: an email inviting a colleague to the platform, paired with the ability to share playlists directly with them.</p>

                <div class="w-richtext">
                  <p>Our first design push focused on making the existing student profiles far more useful. We redesigned the experience to surface progress data clearly and give educators a reason to return.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-style-h5">Step 4: The Notes concept</h3>
                <div class="w-richtext">
                  <p>We used <strong>object-oriented UX</strong> to map the relationships between concepts in the product — students, sessions, content, goals — and identified Notes as a connective tissue that could bridge them all.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>User testing revealed important nuances:</p>
                  <ul role="list">
                    <li>Educators wanted to <strong>assign goals to notes</strong>, reflecting how they work on IEP cases</li>
                    <li>Session notes needed to be <strong>dated</strong> to track history over time</li>
                    <li>Attaching materials to notes would help with <strong>reporting on what was done</strong> and planning future lessons</li>
                  </ul>

                <h3 class="heading-style-h5">Step 5: Pivoting to Session planning — one feature to rule them all</h3>
                <div class="w-richtext">
                  <p>Testing revealed that what educators truly needed wasn't just notes — it was a structured way to <strong>plan and document an entire session</strong>: the student, the goal, the content, and the outcome. We pivoted from a Notes feature to a Sessions feature that unified all of these elements.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>A <strong>card sorting exercise</strong> validated the direction: Sessions fit intuitively alongside our existing Playlists, Homework, and Student Profiles features — forming a coherent "My Toolkit" mental model for educators.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>We then ran a <strong>fake door test</strong> to gauge interest before committing to full development. This helped us limit frustration from over-promising and gave us confidence in the signal before we invested further.</p>
                  <p>‍</p>
                  <p>After three more rounds of user testing and iteration, we launched <strong>Sessions</strong>.</p>

                <p>Beyond the numbers, educators told us the Sessions feature fundamentally changed how they approached their day. Preparation time dropped, coordination with colleagues improved, and student progress became something the whole team could see and act on together.</p>

                    <strong>Push harder to reach the full value-add vision.</strong><br>
                    MVPs are valuable, but launching a stripped-down version without the key visualisations resulted in lower initial adoption than anticipated. Setting clear post-launch milestones to close the gap between MVP and the full vision would have helped.

                    <strong>Do more lean experiments before fully investing in one solution.</strong><br>
                    The fake door test proved valuable, but we could have used opportunity solution trees and A/B testing earlier in the process to de-risk our bets before heavy design and engineering investment.

                    <strong>"Quick wins" end up turning into big projects.</strong><br>
                    What started as a simple Notes feature became a full Session planning system. Ensuring full alignment with company mission from the outset helps calibrate scope expectations across teams before work begins.

                    <strong>Design System work is most impactful when embedded in live projects.</strong><br>
                    Process improvements and component development gained far more traction when integrated into the delivery of the Sessions feature than when pursued as standalone initiatives.
